        <p>
          It would be interesting to have a solution for archiving digital 
          signatures.
          E.g. all LADOK papers must be stored on paper with a signature on it.
          Since there's no solution yet of how to do this for digital 
          signatures, we cannot use digital signatures when signing LADOK 
          papers.
        </p>
        <p>
          An expected solution would use smartphones and QR-codes to scan the 
          document and do the verification (the QR-code being the actual 
          signature).
        </p>
        <p>
          A more interesting solution would be human-verifiable digital 
          signatures, which are human verifiable but still unforgeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is security, but evident privacy in this project.
          Probably some privacy aspects will show up.
